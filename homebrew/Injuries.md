Basing our homebrew on this system - [Doc Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCWlBiEN1kjyuWP-usIPDybUItE1ad1RLZ2ZRynJq9s/edit#heading=h.sav9f6noz6us)
There are other variants of this but they tend to be more complicated or have greater immediate risk for permanent damage.

[Lingering Injuries Reference](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Injuries)

Will sumarise our system here.
# Injuries

#### Risk
Instead of dropping to `0 hit points,` you may choose to become injured rather than suffer the immediate effects of dying. If you do, you make a `DC 13 Constitution saving throw`. On a *success*, you `gain an injury` and can immediately roll any number of `hit dice` and `regain hit points `(minimum 1).  

`Roll 2d10 `on the *Injury* table. You `add 1` to this roll for each` hit die` you have remaining. You gain the listed injury until you recover. 

#### Recovery
At the end of a `long rest`, you can choose to make a `Constitution saving throw` against an `Injury’s DC.` On a success, the injury *effect ends*, and you gain `1d3  levels of exhaustion`. 

You can also *remove* an *injury* with a `regenerate or heal spell,` or similar effect. If you do, the *injury ends*, and you gain `3 levels of exhaustion`.
