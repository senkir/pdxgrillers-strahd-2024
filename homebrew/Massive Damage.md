[DNDBeyond Massive Damage Source](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#MassiveDamage)

This optional rule makes it easier for a creature to be felled by *massive damage*.

When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than `half its hit point maximum,` it must succeed on a` DC 15 Constitution saving throw` or suffer a `random` effect determined by a roll on the `System Shock table`. 

For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

This applies to both PCs and Enemies.

#### [System Shock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#SystemShock)

|d10|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|The creature drops to 0 hit points.|
|2–3|The creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable.|
|4–5|The creature is [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Stunned) until the end of its next turn.|
|6–7|The creature can’t take reactions and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.|
|8–10|The creature can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.|

## Flavor Effect
[optional] at player/dm discretion we can say that if you roll between 1-5 you obtain a flavor effect relating to the type of damage.  Players free to come up with something else (have fun with it).

*recovery*
