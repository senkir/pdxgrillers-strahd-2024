# Setting Expectations

#### Game Details
[Mood] : Spooky horror vibes.  The world id Dark, Wild, Dangerous.  Unfamiliar.
[Tone] :  The place is tainted by something most foul.  

[Characters] : Start at level 2
[Danger] : There is a chance that players won't make it out in one piece.

	* player gets to 0 hp but isn't killed
	* takes a critical hit

[Lingering Injuries Reference](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Injuries)

* Inspiration.  [DM] can award inspiration, which is an extra die that can be used to give advantage at a later date.
#### Combat:

* players can communicate within reason in the same space
* there's not a strict timeline on turns but it is expected to be thinking about your moves between rounds
* [DM] reserves the right to cut off talk and prompt for the player action if things seem like they are taking too long or there is excessive meta-gaming during a round.

# Safety Tools

* sent out a spreadsheet to cover lines/veils to give players an opportunity to indicate any particular topics that may be sensitive
* our [X Card].  
	* if any player is uncomfortable with the situation they should send me this picture of [David Duchovny] from the show [Californication].
