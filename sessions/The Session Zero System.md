Went over the following with the group:

* [x] explain tone and expectations
* [x] talk about safety tools (ie: things we could be uncomfortable with)
* [ ] message out a form to give players a chance to call out any topic issues
* [ ] talk about classes players might try to do any rolling at the table for stats & HP etc
* [x] any house rules we might want to try
* [x] story paths for character creation (see below)


## Discussions

* players would like to be in RP mode the majority of the time
* out of character maybe 30 percent

#### House Rules

* at [DM] discretion we will occasionally allow a failed roll to succeed *at a cost*
* 

#### Combat:

* players can communicate within reason in the same space
* there's not a strict timeline on turns but it is expected to be thinking about your moves between rounds
* [DM] reserves the right to cut off talk and prompt for the player action if things seem like they are taking too long or there is excessive meta-gaming during a round

## Part 1

* expectations checklist

```quote
We are playing in a world that is mostly self contained.  Meaning unlike our previous game there will most likely be less individual backstory elements included in the main throughline.


```


* `compromise` and generous `communication`
`Strahd` has a lot of elements built in, that said we can try to call out player preference for the following:
`combat-heavy` vs `puzzles` vs `political intrigue`

*  tone `the situation`
	* the situation feeling
	* the place seems
	* the person appears to be
* mood `the individual player`
	* our world is
	* the vibe is
	* people here can be

```mood and tone
Mood:
our world is... Dark, Wild, Dangerous
the vibe is... Unsettled and Mystifying
People heare can be... weary and worn down

Tone:
This situation leaves us feeling... worried if we'll make it out
This place seems...tained by something most foul
This person appears to be... untrusting and suspicious


```

the above can be rewritten and change based on location and NPCs the characters are dealing with.

## Part 2

### Safety Tools



## Part 3
the `story path`

* where did you come from
* who was someone that had a monumental impact on your life?
* what is an event that set you on the path you still walk today?

this leads to discovering the `why` during the adventure!


```Preface
The players are a group of adventurers just having completed a score.
They are on their way to claim their reward. (or similar? workshop this)
Regardless we join them as they are in a jovial mood.
...
then the mists close in...
